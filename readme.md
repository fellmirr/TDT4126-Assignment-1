# Assignment 2 - TDT4136

Implementation of the A* algorithm. In visualizations, the deepest blue color indicates the current best path, the slightly lighter shade indicates previous best paths, and the lightest indicates nodes created when searching. Nodes created are not shown for areas with cost > 1, such as stairs.

Results are generated by running the `Taks.py` file.

``` python3 Tasks.py ```

## Code

The code consists of a ` SearchNode ` class, a ` Astar ` class and a ` Tasks ` script, in addition to the provided map class.

The search node is more or less a direct implementation from the provided essentials of the a* algorithm, with the omission of the status enum. Astar implements the core loop, and has methods for generating successor nodes and evaluating heuristic distance (i'm using manhatten distance). Tasks is simply a script to run the algorithm with the different initial conditions for the tasks.

I've modified the provided ` Map ` class somewhat, so that the ` show_map ` method now returns an image file, rather than showing the image. The astar class stores a snapshot of the best current path as an image on each iteration. These images (frames) are then converted into a gif in the ` Tasks ` script.
